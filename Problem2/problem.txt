Problem: Longest Subarray with K Distinct Integers

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray that contains exactly k distinct integers.

Example1: 
  Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], k = 2
  Output: 4
  Explanation: The longest subarray with exactly 2 distinct integers is [1, 2, 1, 2] which has length 4.

Example2: 
  Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4], k = 3
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The longest subarray with exactly 3 distinct integers is [1, 2, 1] or [2, 1, 3] which has length 3.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= nums.length
