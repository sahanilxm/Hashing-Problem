Problem Statement: - Given an integer array nums and an integer k, your task is to determine the number of unique pairs (i, j) where i != j and |nums[i] - nums[j]| == k.

Example1: 
  Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
  Output: 2
  Explanation: There are two pairs (1, 3) and (3, 5) where the absolute difference is 2.

Example2: 
  Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
  Output: 4
  Explanation: There are four pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5) where the absolute difference is 1.

Constraints: 
  - The array length nums is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
  - Each element in nums is between -10,000,000 and 10,000,000 inclusive.
  - The integer k is between 0 and 10,000,000 inclusive.
